# Notes from Data and Metrics event on January 23, 2018

### Create E-Library
Build a library online where we can share findings, information and existing resources. Include existing resources from slides, Alliance for affordable internet, Berkman Center, Open Technology Institute, E-Vermont and VCRD

### Funding 
Seek funding to pursue a small study of Burlington, Winooski, Colchester and maybe others. USDA, Schurz, Bay & Paul Foundation, Vermont Community Foundation, Congressional reps re workforce development, CCRPC

### Partners
Reach out to potential partners like VT schools, Tarrant Institute and others. 

### Background
Focus on Winooski and Burlington to start. Next level would include Colchester, S. Burlington and maybe Milton. Winooski's community and economy department will be helpful. Look at population statistics to narrow down and select which area to focus on. 

### Process suggestions
* Create a two page proposal with a budget 
* Start with a defined scope and scale up to state level
* Look into Digital Inclusion Interns with E-Vermont
* Leverage the fact that a study of this kind will provide regional market data to funders
* Tie in work force development for appeal at congressional level
